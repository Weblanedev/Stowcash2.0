            <h5 className='font-semibold '>Custom Charges</h5>
            All shipments crossing international borders are subject to the assessment of duties and taxes imposed by the importing countryâ€™s government. Stowcash has no control over these charges as they vary between countries. They are your responsibility. Shipping fees do not cover duties and taxes; shipping fees are paid to the shipping company and duties and taxes are paid to your government. Please note that shipping fees are non-refundable and return shipping costs are the customer's responsibility. Stowcash does not provide return shipping labels. A handling fee will be assessed on orders that are refused by the customer at the time of delivery or returned due to an "undeliverable" or incomplete address.

            <br />
            <h5 className='font-semibold '>Pre-Order Items</h5>
            Pre-order item(s) have their "Shipping Starts" date in the item description, which is the date they become available to start shipping out.<br /> Processing time will start on that date provided and will be 1-2 business days for express orders and 5-7 business days for standard orders. If your order includes a pre-order item, all the items will ship together. If you wish to split up the order, there will be an additional shipping cost.

            If you have not yet received your order within the estimated
            delivery time, please allow an extra 2-3 days because packages may
            be delayed.
